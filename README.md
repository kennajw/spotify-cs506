# spotify-cs506

Proposal:
The goal of this project is to successfully predict the percentage of an artist's playtime over all their songs as well as individual playtime for each track.

Data Needs: we will be using the Spotify Streaming History dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sgoutami/spotify-streaming-history) and we will be collecting: ms_played, artist_name, track_name, reason_start, reason_end, shuffle. We will be modeling based on 80% of data, keeping 20% for testing our results.

Modelling: Clustering.

Visualization: Bar Graphs.

Test Plan: Withhold 20% of data for test, train on data collected in March, and test on data collected in April.
